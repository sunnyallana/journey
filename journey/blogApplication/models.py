Custom managers are useful when we want to put custom methods in the manager and make those methods available to the model objects.

    ''' Queries with field lookup methods are built using two underscores, for example publish__year. The __year part is a field lookup method that retrieves the year from the date field. Django supports many field lookup methods, such as __year, __month, __day, __gt (greater than), __lt (less than), __gte (greater than or equal to), __lte (less than or equal to), and many others.
        Same notation is used to access related objects. For example, author__username will retrieve the username field from the related User model.
